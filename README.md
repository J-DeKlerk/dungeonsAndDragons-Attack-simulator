# dungeonsAndDragons-Attack-simulator
i helped work on this project as a personal favour to a friend. he wanted to run his own campaign of dungeons and dragons however he hated the tedious process of keeping track of health and damage over time, we worked together to create a python application that simulates everything for him.
